# This is the progress i've done and added

## i have added a forgotpassword.html page.
## for the forgotpasword option that is in the login page.
##added some css to it too.
I have also added a
---
javascript event listener for submitting the email
---

## you will notice that when a user clicks on submit then nothing happens.

## you will try to configure the backend of it so that the event listener will fetch from the backend server

## also am working on the module2 branch ðŸ˜„ i dont want to destroy the production especially from backend ðŸ˜†

## you will merge it after you have checkd and synced chnages from your side too
